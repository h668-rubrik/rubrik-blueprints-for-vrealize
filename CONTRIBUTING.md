# Rubrik Blueprints for vRealize

## New Blueprint Development

The Rubrik Plugin for vRealize can be found [here](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-vrealize). 

Once a new blueprint has been added you will then submit a new Pull Request which will be reviewed before merging into the `devel` branch.
